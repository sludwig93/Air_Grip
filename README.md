Software to run Dorna robot arm


I uploaded everything I worked on here, but only a few files are really important.
- dorna_functions_v2.py houses the functions used to operate the robot arm
- dorna_GUI_v2.py runs the GUI for simple use of the robot arm
      Neither of these files were really finished, there are probably many errors in the code which we were not able to fix due to the COVID situation.
- rev2.ui is the QtDesigner file for the GUI (QtDesigner is the GOAT and you should 100% learn it when updating the GUI)


Everything is in Python- make sure you read our final project paper which is also uploaded here for a brief background on what we did.


Modules you'll need to run these programs (off the top of my head, see the imports in the files themselves for a more accurate list)
- dorna
- json
- PyQt5


Before trying to run these programs, you should visit Dorna's website and use their browser based software to become familiar with the robot. Then, look at the documentation for their API for a basic understanding of the commands that are available.
